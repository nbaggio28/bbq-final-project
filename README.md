## Data Set Information:

The widely used Statlog German credit data ([[Web Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/South+German+Credit+%28UPDATE%29)]), as of November 2019, suffers from severe errors in the coding information and does not come with any background information. The 'South German Credit' data provide a correction and some background information, based on the Open Data LMU (2010) representation of the same data and several other German language resources.

- 700 good and 300 bad credits with 20 predictor variables. Data from 1973 to 1975. Stratified sample from actual credits with bad credits heavily oversampled. A cost matrix can be used.

## Attribute Information:

> - ### This section contains a brief description for each  attribute.
> 
> - ### Details on attribute coding can be obtained from the accompanying R code for reading the data
>   ### or the accompanying code table, as well as from Groemping (2019) (listed under 'Relevant Papers').
